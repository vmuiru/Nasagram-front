 This project was inspired by the amount of time I spend on Instagram. I remembered my dad telling me that I need to go outside instead of looking at just people. Being in a pandemic stricken world, I figured since I cant spend time outside as I'd like. I brought outer space to me.
 In this app users can view the astonomy picture of the day as well each picture from the previous year.
